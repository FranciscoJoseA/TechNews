  Youtube Music launch a website whit thousands of covers from Billie Eilish's song: Bad Guy. The initiative pretends to celebrate the massive success of music that already has more than one billion views on Youtube.<br>
  Despite always hearing the same music, the platform promises to be anything but boring. Artificial intelligence makes it possible to move from one cover to another and continue on the same part of the music as the previous one. "Once you click or tap the start button, three videos will load, one with audio. Click or tap another video to switch to its audio." It is possible to select the type of cover we hear thanks to the various hashtags that appear in a lower bar or through the search. When paused, the page presents varied statistics such as the minutes and covers seen and the chosen hashtags. All the designs and creativeness of the website have the Billie Eilish theme.<br>
  After all, I can see a future in these types of projects. We can be in the presence of a new kind of promotion that artists do not dispense in the future. What do you think of this new concept?<br>
  Were you able to spend hours listening to that song that you can't get out of your head?
